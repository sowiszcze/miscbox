# netboot.xyz is a convenient place to boot into any type of operating system
# or utility disk without the need of having to go spend time retrieving the
# ISO just to run it. iPXE is used to provide a user friendly menu from within
# the BIOS that lets you easily choose the operating system you want along
# with any specific types of versions or bootable flags.
